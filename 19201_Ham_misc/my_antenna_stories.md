## Accessing the distant repeater (Kevin to Highwood Baldy)

FB 190820:  Hey everyone, I was trying to talk to my Dad in Lava Hot springs Idaho from my home in Woods Cross Utah through a 2 meter fm repeater out there 115 miles away, with my Kenwood tm v71a (full power 50 watts), lmr 400 coax and 5/8 wave antenna hung on my roof.

I could key up the repeater just fine but but apparently I was only just barely understandable.

Bill Vodall I've seen similar cases where raising the antenna (a small beam) made all the difference. It went from scratch to a strong readable signal.

## 75 meter Full Wave Loop

FB:  Craig B. Single band? If so, feed with a quarter wave stub of 75 ohm coax to your 50 ohm coax and use a 1:1 balun to balance it.

I did this once to build a resonant antenna aiming for the Montana traffic net in the early evenings on 3.910 MHz. I used a Heath dip meter, tuned by a nearby receiver, to trim the length of both the full wave radiator and the 1/4 wave 75 ohm matching section. It was NVIS low - only 10 to 20 feet high.

It was the best in state antenna I ever had.  Great signal in state but it wouldn't go any further...   I tried to use it to talk to friends in Colorado and it never worked well.

## Rotatable Vertical

FB:  Just wondering if there is a way to make my antenna raise and lower mechanically.

BV: I once worked where the Ham club had permission to put an antenna on the roof - but were required to keep it out of sight as much as possible. So they put up one of the multiband verticals - on a rotator. At one position the vertical has flat horizontal on the roof. Rotating it 90 degrees swung the antenna straight up and vertical. A small TV antenna rotator was adequate.
