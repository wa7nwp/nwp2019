Raspberry Pi 4 With an SSD: Dramatic Speed Improvements, Higher Price TOMSHARDWARE.COM

Miguel D I have a 500gb Samsung Micrco SD card and the element14 Pidesktop (Pi3 B+) both without problems.

Kevin R I would advise go to SSD asap. You'll get faster read/write speeds and they are much more reliable in the long term. I haven't gotten around to buying a Pi 4 yet but getting it setup on my 3b+ was a breeze.

Bill Vodall Use separate storage device for the OS and your data. When (not IF) you have to re-install the OS, you won't also have to re-install the data.

Jonathan K Bill totally agree with you. Manager in my office had a ssd crash yesterday and I am dreading having to reinstall all the software. At least the company information is all backed up.

Bill V I haven't been here yet - will soon - I do know I've never heard somebody with an SSD unhappy. When I do get my first SSD, I'm going to shop carefully and make sure to get a better unit that has a significant RAM cache built in. More expensive sure but it will be even faster and last longer.
