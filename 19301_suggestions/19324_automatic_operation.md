# Autonomous Ham Radio Station and Operation

The real world is moving towards automation and AI (Artificial Intelligence) where ever possible.  It makes it faster, more reliable and often better.

This is not currently appreciated in the Ham Radio world.  Automation, rather than being hearalded as the next breakthrough, is looked down upon as a threat to the art.

The technical challenge of building an automatic station to - for example - see how many contacts can be made in an hour - is a boundary breaking technological challenge.

Yes - this needs to be separated from manual operation.   Simply put all automatica/machine operation in the unattended band segments and ban it from the other frequencies.    Since this is moving much of the traffic to a small segment - the small segment size should be adjusted appropriately - like double it.
