# Voice Input

After my hand(s) were incapacitated, I acquired a whole new respect for the power of speech input - both for text and control.

## Android Phone

Raw Text input to apps is limited compared to what's available on the iPhone.  Android only gives basic operations like new line, new paragraph, period, comma and question mark.  I'm still searching for the command to 'enter' or 'send' a message.

On the other hand, (ouch) controlling the phone is far more functional.   Here are some resources:

My Favorites
* one
* two

## PC - Windows
* Much functionality in Word.
* Will it work with (G)VIM?
