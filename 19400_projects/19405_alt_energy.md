# Alternate Energy

## General Notes

### DC low voltage connectors
* Anderson Power Pole (PowerWerx etc) for 13.8+
* S.A.E. car connectors for 12V as seen on an AGM battery not charging
* https://www.hobbytown.com/wire-connectors-electronics-cars-trucks/c7308
* I use the small Molex for the 9.6V batteries.
* These XT60 will be for 6 volts applications - IE. one 6V AGM battery - https://www.hobbytown.com/wire-connectors-electronics-cars-trucks/c7308

Look at the XT60 kits.  (and XT30..)

(Hm - maybe I'll go with the 6V standard.  Or ...   Bill - watch this.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4oltPESvhU )

## Phase 1 - until now
* One panel per year

## Phase 2 - Radio forever -

### Goal
* Power basic APRS station full time from solar charged battery
* Power Internet - modem and simplest WiFi

### Notes
* 2 ten watt solar panels charging a X AH gelcel
   * 3/21/20 - battery was down to 9V after years of resting on the deck.  One solar panel is putting from 30 to 300 mA
   * found and hooked up X meter
  
## Phase 3 - Home Power Basics

### Goal
* Power lights

### Notes
* 400 watts solar, maybe 500
* propane generator for backup
   * Baja 900 from Home Depot
