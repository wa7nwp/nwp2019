# Ham Mesh Home Lab

Ready for an adventure? Get 3 of the small cheap GL-Inet AR150 travel routers. Install the AREDN software and build your own home mesh. It'll be incredibly educational and a lot of fun.

One node is often lonely - you're at the mercy of other users and your location.

Two nodes is a link - you don't experience the magic of the Mesh.

Three nodes lets you experiment endlessly. You control the software and the locations. You see how the mesh works and its advantages and disadvantages.
