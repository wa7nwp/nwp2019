## Basics

JNOS has two modes

## Basic Command Operation
JNOS has a handy shortcut of commands.  Only the first relevate letters are needed.  For example, the commands *help* and *hecho*.
the first two letters, *he* and common.   So you have to give three at least.  For *help*, enter *hel* or *help*.  For *hecho* enter *hec*
*hech* or *hecho*

* To list the commands availble, enter "?" or "help" at the command prompt *+++*
* For more info on any one command, (like *hecho*..)  enter *help hecho*.   All the help text is contained in individual files
in the jnos-home/help folder.
* To quit, enter ex(it).   You will be prompted if you really want to exit

### OS commands
