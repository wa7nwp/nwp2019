### FSQ Bellingham

The main FSQ event around Bellingham, including Ferndale , Blaine, Birch Bay, and Linden, and beyond, Is the Sunday morning ragchew on 145.580 wide band FM Symplex. It starts around nine and goes until everyone runs out of steam. Start fldigi, select FSQ 6 or 4.5, ensure the “FSQ-ON” button is on, and send “allcall *”. If you get any replies, you’re good to go. Adjust the gray squelch bar at the bottom right so that it’s just above the bouncing green bar with no signal being received.

Reach out to this group if you have more questions -  Google Groups "Northwest Washington Digital Amateur Radio" group.
