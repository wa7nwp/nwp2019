Q. How would you recommend mounting a 2m mobile antenna on a pickup ('14 F150) that goes in parking garages on a daily basis?

Joe B: A $6 quarter wave in a permanent mount in the center of the roof. No different than my full sized SUV. And an NMO mount will accommodate anything you want to put on it for longer trips, etc

Bill V:  This! The 19" whip will work almost as well as a 5/8 and perhaps better if well mounted in the optimum location.
