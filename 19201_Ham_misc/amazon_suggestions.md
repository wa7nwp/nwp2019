   + Q. Hello everyone. I just received my technician license over the weekend and I was wondering does anyone have a recommendation on books that will teach me how to actually operate. Going in and just turning dials isn't how I like to learn. I'm more of a reader when it comes to learning something complex.
   + A. The ARRL Operating Manual is a good start. https://amzn.to/2l4amUj
