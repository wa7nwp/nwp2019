Q: I have a Pi but don't know where to start with Direwolf?

Do you have a radio hooked to your rPI. Receive only is all you need to start. DRAWS is the Cadillac. A straight thru cable is good enough to start with. Once that's hooked up - install and run DIREWOLF. It will probably work, receive only, right out of the box. It's done that for me two of the last three installs. On the third one I have to change the audio source from something like the default 0 to 1.

Then you will watch the APRS packets flow - assuming you're receiving on 144.390.

Then you can hook up the transmit and PTT (DIREWOLF, USB Signaling, Fe-Pi with Easy Digi) and start tweaking the DIREWOLF config file for things like your callsign and digipeating.
