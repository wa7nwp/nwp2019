# Source Control 

 *see the bottom line...*

For months I've been contemplating a long informative post discussing
the beauty of source control in general and GIT(Hub) in particular.

Too often distracted (squirrel and donut) I didn't get it done.  So
rather than further delay the world changing progress - here's a brief
post with an important suggestion at the end..

* Source Control is awesome.  One of the greatest inventions of the
computer era..   It allows organizing content (files) of all sorts and
provides for tracking changes.
* Several versions are available.  Today the favorite used by folk is
GIT - as created by Mr Linux himself Linux.
* Endless info and videos exist - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git
* It's complicated.  Forget about that.  Its basic operation is very simple.
* There are multiple 'free' (as in donuts and squirrel) cloud sites
hosting GIT and associated tools.  GitHub is one of the most common.
GitLab or BitBucket may be better.  There's always one better...
* For years I was missing the 'cloud' functionality of being able to
make changes to my source control content online over the cloud.
Reading content was straight forward.  Changing it securely wasn't.
GitHub has fixed that.
* A lot more to discuss....  Associated tools and processes seem endless.

* If not already there - get a GitHub account - https://github.com/
