FB:  Amateur (Ham) Radio on a Budget

### Q. How would you recommend mounting a 2m mobile antenna on a pickup ('14 F150) that goes in parking garages on a daily basis?

Joe B: A $6 quarter wave in a permanent mount in the center of the roof. No different than my full sized SUV. And an NMO mount will accommodate anything you want to put on it for longer trips, etc

Bill V:  This! The 19" whip will work almost as well as a 5/8 and perhaps better if well mounted in the optimum location.

### Q. I've built a 1/4 wave.  It works but I want to build something a little better.

BV: Read the three PDF downloads (QST articles) from the end of Ed Fong's web page. That will give you a good boost to learning antenna tricks. [Eds Antennas](https://edsantennas.weebly.com/about.html)


### Q. Converted this cb antenna to 40 meters. it is almost solid wrapped with 18 gauge wire top to bottom minus about 4 inches each end. 

BV: "wrapped with wire bottom to top" -- which is exactly how you make a loaded antenna. Very touchy to tune up and inefficient but with lots to care tuning and trimming of the effective length it should work.

### Q.  What's a good first project for a Raspberry PI?

BV Build a pi-hole to reduce ads and unnecessary web activity. It's educational, fun to see working and useful. [PI-Hole](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pi-hole-raspberry-pi)
