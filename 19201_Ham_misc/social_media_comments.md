## 146.52 Calling Frequency

BV 190709: The problem is there may be folks monitoring on 52 that don't want to list to extended discussions.  I can see them just turning off their radio to deal with the extraneous distracting noise.   
Perhaps establishing a Tone convention, like APRS Voice Alert, would allow priority calls to be made while keeping the radio quiet for standard traffic.

FB 190707: If we members want to communicate - we can just post on one of the well organized group of Facebook pages. :) (It's not like there are 2 billion other folk finding it useful.)

FB 190707: New or upgraded licences should get a free 1 year digital membership. High school and younger students should get a greatly reduced membership rate. Us seniors too. (First time I've been able to say that.)
Hopefully the goal I saw last year of a mere 5% membership decrease has been revised. That's inexcusable in this era of techy awesomeness.
