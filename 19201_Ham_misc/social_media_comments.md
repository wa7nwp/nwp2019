## Kenwood TH-D74 and ICOM DStar

BV 190709 - Was a firmware update ever released that added DStar slow-slow (900 bps) data to the DStar fast-slow (4800 bps) data initially provisioned in the D74? The slow-slow data is standard with most of the Icom DStar gear.

   Adrian F. - No, and what was more dissapointing was that an editable gps sentence field waznt added as requested to Kenwood by AE5PL to allow dprs calculator gps beaconing with any d-star gateway that supported the same in Icom gear.

## 146.52 Calling Frequency

BV 190709: The problem is there may be folks monitoring on 52 that don't want to list to extended discussions.  I can see them just turning off their radio to deal with the extraneous distracting noise.   
Perhaps establishing a Tone convention, like APRS Voice Alert, would allow priority calls to be made while keeping the radio quiet for standard traffic.

## ARRL

FB 190707: If we members want to communicate - we can just post on one of the well organized group of Facebook pages. :) (It's not like there are 2 billion other folk finding it useful.)

FB 190707: New or upgraded licences should get a free 1 year digital membership. High school and younger students should get a greatly reduced membership rate. Us seniors too. (First time I've been able to say that.)
Hopefully the goal I saw last year of a mere 5% membership decrease has been revised. That's inexcusable in this era of techy awesomeness.
