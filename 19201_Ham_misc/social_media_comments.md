## Speed of Light and Length of Antennas

In https://www.kb6nu.com/468-ham-radios-magic-number - he says the 468 has a mysterious past.   Not so mysterious as it's assuming a 95% velocity factor of 492.

Magical 492 is derived from the speed of light - 299.8 million meters per second

## Band Edges and LSB on 10 meters

I'm calling CQ on 28.300 MHz with LSB...

BV 190724 - For all the comments, does everybody now understand why LSB on 28.300 is technically illegal in the US? The transmission is still in the 10 meter Ham band but outside of the 10 M Voice segment. LSB is not 'wrong' on 10 meters but it is atypical and may add confusion.

A similar frequency example is APRS packet on the 30 meter band. One valid listing is to say 10.151 MHz dial frequency with LSB - even though that's outside the edge of the Ham band at 10.150 MHz. When a 1.7 KHz tone carrier is modulated on a 10.151 LSB - the result is a carrier on 10.149.3 - which is inside the Ham band and legal.

## Kenwood TH-D74 and ICOM DStar

BV 190709 - Was a firmware update ever released that added DStar slow-slow (900 bps) data to the DStar fast-slow (4800 bps) data initially provisioned in the D74? The slow-slow data is standard with most of the Icom DStar gear.

   Adrian F. - No, and what was more dissapointing was that an editable gps sentence field waznt added as requested to Kenwood by AE5PL to allow dprs calculator gps beaconing with any d-star gateway that supported the same in Icom gear.

## 146.52 Calling Frequency

BV 190709: The problem is there may be folks monitoring on 52 that don't want to list to extended discussions.  I can see them just turning off their radio to deal with the extraneous distracting noise.   
Perhaps establishing a Tone convention, like APRS Voice Alert, would allow priority calls to be made while keeping the radio quiet for standard traffic.

## ARRL

FB 190707: If we members want to communicate - we can just post on one of the well organized group of Facebook pages. :) (It's not like there are 2 billion other folk finding it useful.)

FB 190707: New or upgraded licences should get a free 1 year digital membership. High school and younger students should get a greatly reduced membership rate. Us seniors too. (First time I've been able to say that.)
Hopefully the goal I saw last year of a mere 5% membership decrease has been revised. That's inexcusable in this era of techy awesomeness.
