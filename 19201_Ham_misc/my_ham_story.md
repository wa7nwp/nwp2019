# Ham History of ...7NWP

## Timeline
+ 1984/08 - Drove to Seattle with friend DH.  Practicing and practing the CW Morse Code.  First spent a night in Wolf Creek with Gary and Ethel - brought in the Coco and practiced.  We stopped at the Heights motel on the West side of Spokane.  My first opportunity to watch the Ed Abbey b&w movie, *Lonely Are The Brave*.  Then more practising with the Coco.
+ 2019/10 - applied for and received the vanity call W7NWP.  Following the lead of W7NPA yet again.  I met the previous holder of W7NWP a couple years ago at the Stanwood Hamfest and, when I find it, I will post the picture.  http://www.ae7q.com/query/text/Vanity.php
