## Log
* New account created
* using old rabit ears
* -1 New account required credit card out of the box - no way to bypass it even if I wanted to go manual to start with.
* Had to unplug and re-plug the hard disk.  Now it noticed it and offered to reformat as expected.

## Questions
* It reformats the disk - is it Linux using one of the standard Linux formats?
* Will it work with VLC - apparently yes as a search showed various VLC ap [extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=tablo+tv+vlc&oq=tablo+tv+vlc)
* How do I save video files?   Automatically?  How about editing to trim ends and remove commercials?
